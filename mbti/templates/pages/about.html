    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Welcome to our website! Here, we explore the fascinating world of the 16 personality types, based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).
        MBTI is a psychological framework that categorizes individuals into one of 16 distinct personality types based on their preferences in four key areas:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I):</strong> Where do you focus your energy?</li>
        <li><strong>Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N):</strong> How do you gather information?</li>
        <li><strong>Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F):</strong> How do you make decisions?</li>
        <li><strong>Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P):</strong> How do you interact with the world around you?</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Based on these preferences, each of the 16 personality types is formed, resulting in unique combinations like INTJ, ENFP, and ISFJ. This system is widely used in personal development, career guidance, and relationship compatibility.

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Science Behind MBTI</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The MBTI is based on Carl Jung’s theory of psychological types. It was developed by Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother, Katharine Cook Briggs, during the 1940s. Their work aimed to make Jung’s theory more accessible and applicable to individuals’ personal and professional lives.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Although MBTI is widely used, it has been the subject of criticism in psychological circles. Critics argue that it oversimplifies human behavior and lacks strong scientific backing. Despite this, many people find MBTI to be a useful tool for self-awareness, personal growth, and understanding others.
